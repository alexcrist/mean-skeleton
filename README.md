#mean-skeleton
A basic skeleton for MEAN stack projects.

One controller, one router, one directive. Also example mongoose model and schema for MongoDB stuff.

To run, 
- boot up MongoDB (on OSX with mongodb installed, type `mongod`)
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- install bower components with `bower install` (Note: you may have to run `npm install bower -g` first)
- run `npm run start`
